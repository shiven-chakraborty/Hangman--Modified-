# Hangman--Modified-
Hangman is a game almost every child has played before. It is generally a 2 person game but could be played by any number of people. In this, one player thinks of a word and writes it in form of blanks, with the number of blanks being the number of letters. Then the guesser guesses the individual letters of the word. If the guess is correct, the letter will replace the blank making it easier to guess the word. If incorrect, the picture of the hangman would be drawn. The exception is that if a letter is being repeated in the word, the player who gives the word has to replace the blank with the letter as many times as it has been repeated. It has limited number of tries and becomes very intense in the last phase of the game. Hope you enjoy!
